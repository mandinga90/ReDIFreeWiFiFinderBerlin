# ReDI Free WiFi Finder Berlin
## Abstract
This is a sample project of the Android App Development Course at [ReDI school](wwww.redi-school.org).
The app shows free WiFi venues in a Google Maps fragment. App users can add new venues or edit or even delete existing venues by using the floating action buttons. Venues are stored in Ruby on Rails API on [redi-free-wifi.herokuapp.com](redi-free-wifi.herokuapp.com/).
To access the API Retrofit 2 is used. For managing permissions PermissionsDispatcher is included.
This sample code serves as a code stub for being extended by ReDI students.

## Possible Features to extended
- Add a venue on the user's location (make it draggable)
- Use a service to directly get an address for a location
- Get categories and add them directly to the spinner and validation
- Validation of user interface
- User login (API enhancement+)
- ...
